the world is everything that is the case
the facts in logical space are the world
the world divides into facts
a logical entity cannot be merely possible
a new possibility cannot subsequently be found
a spatial object must lie in infinite space
the object is simple
objects form the substance of the world
therefore they cannot be compound
this fixed form consists of the objects
