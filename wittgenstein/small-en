the world is everything that is the case
the facts in logical space are the world
the world divides into facts
a logical entity cannot be merely possible
a new possibility cannot subsequently be found
a spatial object must lie in infinite space
the object is simple
objects form the substance of the world
therefore they cannot be compound
this fixed form consists of the objects
roughly speaking: objects are colourless
it is form and content
the form is the possibility of the structure
atomic facts are independent of one another
the total reality is the world
we make to ourselves pictures of facts
the picture is a model of reality
the picture is a fact
it is like a scale applied to reality
every picture is also a logical picture
the logical picture can depict the world
what the picture represents is its sense
what is thinkable is also possible
the sign through which we express the though
i call the propositional sign
the propositional sign is a fact
the proposition is articulate
in the proposition the name represents the object
objects i can only name
signs represent them
i can only speak of them
i cannot assert them
the notation for generality contains a prototype
it is a primitive sign
what the signs conceal, their application declares
elucidations are propositions which contain the primitive signs
the proposition itself is an expression
an expression characterizes a form and a content
an expression has meaning only in a proposition
the determination of the values is the variable
the determination is a description of these propositions
and only this is essential to the determination
for the sign is arbitrary
that is the meaning of occam's razor
russell's theory of types
herewith russell's paradox vanishes
a proposition possesses essential and accidental features
this results from the essence of the notation
it is this which all have in common
the proposition reaches through the whole logical space
the applied, thought, propositional sign is the thought
the thought is the significant proposition
the totality of propositions is the language
beautiful
the proposition is a picture of reality
they are all in a certain sense one
the proposition shows its sense
and it says, that they do so stand
a proposition is the description of a fact
one can draw conclusions from a false proposition
by means of propositions we explain ourselves
one cannot get outside it in the representation
reality is compared with the proposition
an illustration to explain the concept of truth
and the same holds of denial, etc
philosophy is not one of the natural sciences
philosophy is not a theory but an activity
a philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations
philosophy limits the disputable sphere of natural science
the propositions show the logical form of reality
they exhibit it
what can be shown cannot be said
for no proposition can answer such a question
the logical forms are anumerical
the elementary proposition consists of names
it is a connexion, a concatenation, of names
absence of this mark means disagreement
the proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions
we say that the truth-conditions are tautological
the truth-conditions are self-contradictory
tautology and contradiction are without sense
they present no possible state of affairs
therefore that product is identical with the proposition
the general propositional form is a variable
propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions
an elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself
the elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions
cæsar of the julian gens
the truth-functions can be ordered in series
every proposition which contradicts another, denies it
only they themselves can justify the inference
all inference takes place a priori
superstition is the belief in the causal nexus
application to tautology and contradiction
so this is not a mathematical fact
probability is a generalization
i call these operations, truth-operations
denial reverses the sense of a proposition
one operation can reverse the effect of another
operations can cancel one another
that is, nothing
truth-functions are not material functions
why suddenly words here
this would need a justification
where is this expedient always to be used
its position in logic must be made clear
there are no pre-eminent numbers
logical operation signs are punctuations
that however is the general form of proposition
logic must take care of itself
we cannot give a sign the wrong sense
frege says
every legitimately constructed proposition must have a sense
and i say
the values of the variables must be determined
we may distinguish 3 kinds of description
1. direct enumeration
hence the common rule according to whic
i separate the concept all from the truth-function
the generality symbol occurs as an argument
it is not correct to render the propositio
what this proposition says is simply that onl
and we see that apparent propositions like
for we really see two different facts
the elementary proposition consists of names
there is no pre-eminent number
what lies in the application logic cannot anticipate
but logic must have contact with its application
the world and life are one
i am my world
but you do not really see the eye
everything we see could also be otherwise
there is no order of things a priori
the general form of truth-function is
this is the general form of proposition
and thus we come to numbers: i defin
a number is the exponent of an operation
the concept number is the variable number
the propositions of logic are tautologies
the propositions of logic therefore say nothing
they are the analytical propositions
this method could be called a zero-method
they `` treat ''  of nothing
and this is their connexion with the world
herein lies the decisive point
hence there can never be surprises in logic
and from a tautology only tautologies follow
in logic process and result are equivalent
logic is transcendental
mathematics is a logical method
mathematical propositions express no thoughts
calculation is not an experiment
mathematics is a method of logic
`` there are natural laws '' 
only uniform connexions are thinkable
it is exactly analogous for space
there is only logical necessity
and they both are right and wrong
the world is independent of my will
all propositions are of equal value
in it there is no value
for all happening and being-so is accidental
it must lie outside the world
hence also there can be no ethical propositions
propositions cannot express anything higher
it is clear that ethics cannot be expressed
ethics are transcendental
ethics and æsthetics are one
at least these consequences will not be events
death is not an event of life
death is not lived through
god does not reveal himself in the world
the riddle does not exist
there is indeed the inexpressible
this shows itself
it is the mystical
the right method of philosophy would be this
